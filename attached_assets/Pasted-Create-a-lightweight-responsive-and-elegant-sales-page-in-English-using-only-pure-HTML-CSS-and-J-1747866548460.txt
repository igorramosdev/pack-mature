Create a lightweight, responsive, and elegant sales page in English using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with smooth scroll animations powered by the AOS library (Animate On Scroll). The page is for the ebook "3,000+ Hot Secrets from a Mature Woman" and should have the following structure and features:

---

1. **Dynamic Geo & Date Notification (above main ebook section):**  
- Display a notification bar or banner near the top of the page saying:  
  "You and 14 other people near [City] have been selected for an EXCLUSIVE PROMOTION until [Date]"  
- The word **EXCLUSIVE** must be visually highlighted with a subtle animation or effect (like glowing or pulsating).  
- The [City] and [Date] must be dynamically fetched using your API token `7e914d5080da7d` from https://ipinfo.io/, showing the visitor's real city and the current date.  
- The date format should be like "May 28, 2025" and always show the current day dynamically.

---

2. **Purchase Notifications:**  
- Show random simulated purchase notifications appearing on the bottom left or right corner every 30-60 seconds, as if other men with common American names are buying the ebook.  
- Example notification text:  
  "[Name] from [City] just purchased the ebook!"  
- Use a small popup style with fade in/out animations.

3. **Header Section:**  
- Large, eye-catching main headline:  
  "Discover 3,000+ Hot Secrets Only Mature Women Know"  
- Subtitle:  
  "Transform your love life with exclusive tips, stories, and techniques you won’t find anywhere else."  
- Below subtitle, display the 3D mockup of the main ebook from this URL:

- Below the mockup, a prominent CTA button "Get the Secrets Now" that smoothly scrolls down to the purchase section.

- Include the main ebook 3D mockup image again here, above the purchase button and price.  
- Large, eye-catching purchase button with the text:  
  "Buy Now for $7.90"  
- The button should be fixed or always visible in this section for easy access.  
- Add a satisfaction guarantee message below or near the button:  
  "**SATISFACTION GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK** within 7 days if you’re not completely satisfied."  
- Use a clean, mature, elegant dark-themed design for this section, emphasizing trust and urgency.

- Include a collapsible FAQ with at least 4 questions relevant to the ebook and purchase, for example:  
  - What is included in the ebook?  
  - How will I receive the ebook after purchase?  
  - Is there a money-back guarantee?  
  - Can I buy the add-ons later if I change my mind?  
- The FAQ should have smooth toggle animations and match the overall design.

- Dark theme with sober, elegant, and mature color tones fitting the "Mature Women" vibe.  
- Use serif or modern fonts that convey sophistication.  
- Smooth scrolling and fully responsive on all devices.  
- Use AOS library for fade and slide animations on headings, bullet points, images, buttons, notifications, and FAQ toggles.

**Important:**  
- Use provided image URLs as placeholders but allow easy replacement later.  
- The checkout page with order bumps is separate, but mention the order bumps with images on this page to build curiosity.  
- The city and date in the notification bar must be fetched dynamically from https://ipinfo.io/ using your API token `7e914d5080da7d`.
